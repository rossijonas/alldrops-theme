# alldrops-theme

_(Request Hugo Version: [0.60.0+](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/))_

This [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme is a fork from [hugo-notepadium](https://github.com/cntrump/hugo-notepadium) with its focus in:

- Looking somewhat familiar to [Medium.com](https://medium.com/).

- Categories support (like [Medium.com 'publications'](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004681607)).

- Multi authors support.

- Privacy.

- Less-to-zero JavaScript.

**This theme purpose is to serve my personal Blog [alldrops.info](https://alldrops.info). If you are interested in helping this project to become an open source and documented theme available at the official Hugo themes section ([themes.hugo.io](https://themes.gohugo.io/)) please contact me.**
